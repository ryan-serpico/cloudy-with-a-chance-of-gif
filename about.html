          <h1>About Cloudy With a Chance of Gif</h1>

<h2>Why I made this</h2>

<p>Back when I was in high school, besides being known as <em>that guy who carries around Steve Jobs&#8217; biography with him everywhere he goes</em>, I was also known for my fascination with weather apps. Around that time, weather apps were a playground of sorts for app designers to toy around with how weather information was displayed. </p>

<p>Apps like <a href="http://thisissolar.com">Solar</a>, <a href="http://weatherlineapp.com">Weather Line</a> and my favorite, <a href="https://darksky.net/app/">Dark Sky</a> always caught my attention as I swiped through my Twitter timeline during class. I would see what people were saying about them, what neat little animations they had, and would eventually buy them. Yes, buy them. <em>With real American dollars.</em></p>

<p>My classmates and teachers never understand my interest in them. The fact that I always had around 20 weather apps on phone at any given time baffled them, and they were confounded when I would eventually tell them that I spent actual money on many of them, especially when there was already a perfectly fine weather built into iOS. </p>

<p>What they didn&#8217;t get was that I couldn&#8217;t care less about the weather. When you live in south Florida, you can assume that its going to be hot as hell and be right 95% of the time. What really interested me was what people could do with this weather data. How could one present weather in a novel way? What animations could be incorporated to pique someones interest? Most importantly, how could they do all of this in a way that still conveyed data in an efficient matter?</p>

<p>Some of those same people that thought I was crazy for being so into weather apps eventually came around to seeing it my way. I even got some <em>oohh&#8217;s</em> and <em>aahh&#8217;s</em> when I showed them how the rain droplets in Solar would fall at an angle if you tilt your phone in a particular direction. </p>

<p>Cloudy With a Chance of Gif is my contribution back to the community of web and native app developers that delighted me with their work in the past. Hopefully one day, this web app is stumbled upon by some high school student in the world who is interested to see what can done with just some weather data. </p>

<h2>What I used</h2>

<ul>
<li>First and foremost, I don&#8217;t think I would&#8217;ve committed to doing this project without first coming across Danial Shiffman&#8217;s Youtube channel. After watching his tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI">Open Weather Map&#8217;s API</a> and another on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8_w11MvH8&amp;t=790s">Giphy&#8217;s</a>, plus one on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoUqnjUC2c">incorporating user input</a>, I felt pretty confident that I&#8217;d be able to take on this challenge.</li>
<li>Because Shiffman used it in his tutorials, I had to use <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, a javascript library meant for artists and those new to coding.</li>
<li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to make things look somewhat pretty.</li>
<li><a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, mainly for bootstrap.</li>
<li>Obviously <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current">Open Weather Map</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI">Giphy&#8217;s</a> API documentation pages.</li>
<li>Countless <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> discussion threads.</li>
<li><a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/css-experiments-with-a-search-form-input-and-button--cms-22069">This</a> tutorial by Paula Borowska to style the search box to make it nicer.</li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en">JSON Formatter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://fontawesome.io">Font Awesome</a> for their icons.</li>
<li>Documentation for the <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph protocol</a></li>
<li>w3&#8217;s <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/howto-favicon">documentation</a> on how to make favicons.</li>
<li>Last, but certainly not least, <a href="https://www.jou.ufl.edu/staff/mindy-mcadams/">professor McAdams</a>, my intro to web apps professor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>

<ul>
<li>This project gave me a crash course in how APIs work. Now, I&#8217;m no API expert at this point, but I&#8217;ll definitely be more comfortable in future projects that use them.</li>
<li>Even though I didn&#8217;t wind up using this piece of knowledge in the final project, I learned how to access array items inside of a json file.</li>
<li>This should&#8217;ve been obvious to me, but you can&#8217;t have two different functions with the same name. It clearly won&#8217;t work.</li>
<li>I learned a little bit about another javascript library, p5.js.</li>
<li>I learned never to use a javascript library you have absolutely no experience with.</li>
<li>I learned how to prevent mobile browsers from zooming into a form by using <code>user-scalable=0</code>. It&#8217;s something I see some sites I visit that <em>frustrates the life out of me</em>. It makes the web page ugly, and I didn&#8217;t want to have any of that on something I worked so hard on.</li>
<li>I learned how to have the form submit the query by hitting the enter key on the keyboard rather than using a button.</li>
<li>Chrome is better for web development than Safari is. <em>Sigh</em>.</li>
<li>Speaking of Chrome, I used its network tools to monitor the API calls that were taking place. This eventually hinted me toward learning that an issue plaguing the web app for weeks was the fact that the Giphy API was being called right when the page loaded.</li>
<li>A basic understanding of what callback functions are and how they work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design decisions</h2>

<p>Two design choices I feel like I need to explain is the lack of a submit button and the inclusion of the actual weather forecast rather than just the gif. </p>

<p>When it comes to the button, it didn&#8217;t fit into the search box I created and ultimately viewed it as being unnecessary. At the top of the main page when a user arrives, it tells the user to hit enter. It may just be me, but I never move my cursor just to click a submit button ever, so I may be biased. </p>

<p>And for the inclusion of the actual weather description, I found it important to do so for the fact that the gif that is returned sometimes doesn&#8217;t relay the actual weather outside. Sometimes it&#8217;s totally irrelevant, other times its misleading. When I was showing this off to one of my friends, a gif that was returned for clear says returned a gif of the Simpsons title with snow floating by it. </p>

<h2>What I want to do in the future</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have it setup where the user doesn&#8217;t have to refresh the page and enter in a city again to see another gif or to see the weather for a different city. This probably involves AJAX, which I don&#8217;t have time to learn right now.</li>
<li>Search suggestions. I already have come across a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7553225/google-suggested-city-name-autocomplete">stackoverflow thread</a> on it, but I don&#8217;t have time to work on it in this initial release.</li>
<li>Polishing the design more.</li>
</ul>
