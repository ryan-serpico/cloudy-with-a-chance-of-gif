# Week one progress report
Week one of work on Cloudy with a Chance of GIF features the [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/) and [Giphy](http://giphy.com) APIs functioning, albeit not together. User input, which comes in the form of a user typing in a city, is working properly. When a user types in Portland, for example, the two dots that represent temperature and humidity changes according to the data from Open Weather Map. It is only meant to display that the Open Weather Map data is still flowing and won't be present in the end product. 

I am satisfied with the progress I have made so far. This week I need to figure out how to have the Open Weather Map API speak to the Giphy API by passing the weather description into a variable that Giphy can query. I also need to figure out what happens when Open Weather Map doesn't have data on the city queried. Having search suggestions under the search bar would also be a great addition.
